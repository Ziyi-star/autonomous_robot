Computer scientists are often required to conduct complex
mathematical computations. This calculator is a program 
implementing functions to automate some of these computations.

**List of Implemented Functions**

- Transpose matrix.
- Add two matrices.
- Multiply two matrices.
- Compute roots of quadratic polynomial.
- Compute factorial.

**Program Execution**

To execute this program cmake is required to be installed.
Open a terminal and change into the directory of the 
`scientific_calculator`.
Afterwards run the following commands.


`cmake --build cmake-build-debug --target scientific_calculator -- -j 4`

`cmake-build-debug/scientific_calculator`

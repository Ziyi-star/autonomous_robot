# Autonomous Robot Control System

## Project Overview
This project contains the embedded software for controlling an autonomous robot. It features various operational modes, real-time sensor integration, motor control, and state management. This software is designed to be used on an AVR-based microcontroller, managing time-critical operations and motor control algorithms.

### Features
- Multi-sensor data integration
- Real-time motor control
- Autonomous navigation algorithms
- Watchdog timer for system stability
- Debugging capabilities via USART communication

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
To use and develop this software, you will need:
- AVR-GCC compiler
- AVRDUDE for programming the microcontroller
- An AVR-based microcontroller, preferably from the ATmega series
- Access to the hardware components such as motors, sensors, etc.
- Optional: Atmel Studio or a similar IDE for development

### Installation
1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Ziyi-star/autonomous_robot.git
   cd autonomous_robot
   ```
2. **Set up your AVR toolchain:**
   Ensure that you have the AVR-GCC compiler and AVRDUDE installed and configured for your microcontroller.

3. **Build the Project:**
   Navigate to the project directory and use the provided Makefile:
   ```bash
   make all
   ```

4. **Upload the Firmware to Your Microcontroller:**
   ```bash
   make upload
   ```

### Configuration
Modify the `config.h` file in the project directory to suit your hardware setup, such as pin assignments, sensor types, and motor configurations.

## Usage
After successfully uploading the firmware to your microcontroller:
1. Power on the system.
2. The robot will initiate its boot sequence, performing self-tests and sensor calibrations.
3. Once the initialization is complete, the robot will enter its default operational mode.
4. Monitor the output via USART for debug messages and status reports.

### Commands
- **Start:** Command the robot to start its navigation routine.
- **Stop:** Immediately halts all motor activity.
- **Reset:** Manually reset the system via a connected interface or automatically through the watchdog timer setup.
